# Postify : A Modem Listener

Postify is a collection of tools that allows you to listen for incoming messages from a modem;
It stores this messages in a MySQL based backend and does a HTTP POST of received messages to 
a specified URL in JSON. Postify was built for common modems (in Nigeria... Yeah I know...) fork
the project to add other kinds of modems (trust me it's not difficult ).
